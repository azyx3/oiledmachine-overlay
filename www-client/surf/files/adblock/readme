file info

All scripts should run with python version 2

adblock - first tier ad block lists
adblock.py - new algorithm
adbserver.pid - mutex block cruft for server
block1.dat - second tier domain buckets
block2.dat - second tier general pattern lists
blocklists.py - block1 and block2 generator.  blocklist.py will take the blocklist and generate those two files one for the faster domain pattern lookup and the other for slower pattern based lookup.
blocksrv.py - old abandoned script that held block list in memory without needing to regenerate every time. It was a database server that surfext.c sent queries to and intended to stay in memory for a long time to reduce overhead.
convert.py - currently active conversion script to convert the remote block lists into adblock.py
customrules - custom rules for blocking
update.sh - adblock updater
whitelist - domains to ignore filtering

Currently WebKit2GTK is also lacking in lower level blocking via soup.
WebKit2GTK won't allow you low level access unlike WebKitGTK+ original
