CVE_2007_3732_SUMMARY_en="In Linux 2.6 before 2.6.23, the TRACE_IRQS_ON \
function in iret_exc calls a C function without ensuring that the segments are \
set properly. The kernel's %fs needs to be restored before the call in \
TRACE_IRQS_ON and before enabling interrupts, so that \"current\" references \
work. Without this, \"current\" used in the window between iret_exc and the \
middle of error_code where %fs is reset, would crash."
