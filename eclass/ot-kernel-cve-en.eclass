CVE_2019_16746_SUMMARY_en="An issue was discovered in net/wireless/nl80211.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.17. It does not check the length of variable elements in a beacon head, leading to a buffer overflow."
CVE_2019_16746_SEVERITY_en="Critical (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_14814_SUMMARY_en="There is heap-based buffer overflow in Linux kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code."
CVE_2019_14814_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_14821_SUMMARY_en="An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel, all versions through 5.3, in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system."
CVE_2019_14821_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_16921_SUMMARY_en="In the Linux kernel before 4.17, hns_roce_alloc_ucontext in drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_main.c does not initialize the resp data structure, which might allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory, aka CID-df7e40425813."
CVE_2019_16921_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_16994_SUMMARY_en="In the Linux kernel before 5.0, a memory leak exists in sit_init_net() in net/ipv6/sit.c when register_netdev() fails to register sitn->fb_tunnel_dev, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-07f12b26e21a."
CVE_2019_16994_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_16995_SUMMARY_en="In the Linux kernel before 5.0.3, a memory leak exits in hsr_dev_finalize() in net/hsr/hsr_device.c if hsr_add_port fails to add a port, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-6caabe7f197d."
CVE_2019_16995_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_17052_SUMMARY_en="ax25_create in net/ax25/af_ax25.c in the AF_AX25 network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-0614e2b73768."
CVE_2019_17052_SEVERITY_en="Low (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_17053_SUMMARY_en="ieee802154_create in net/ieee802154/socket.c in the AF_IEEE802154 network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-e69dbd4619e7."
CVE_2019_17053_SEVERITY_en="Low (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_17054_SUMMARY_en="atalk_create in net/appletalk/ddp.c in the AF_APPLETALK network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-6cc03e8aa36c."

CVE_2019_17055_SUMMARY_en="base_sock_create in drivers/isdn/mISDN/socket.c in the AF_ISDN network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-b91ee4aa2a21."
CVE_2019_17055_SEVERITY_en="Low (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_17056_SUMMARY_en="llcp_sock_create in net/nfc/llcp_sock.c in the AF_NFC network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-3a359798b176."

CVE_2019_17075_SUMMARY_en="An issue was discovered in write_tpt_entry in drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4/mem.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2. The cxgb4 driver is directly calling dma_map_single (a DMA function) from a stack variable. This could allow an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service, exploitable if this driver is used on an architecture for which this stack/DMA interaction has security relevance."
CVE_2019_17075_SEVERITY_en="High (CVSS v3.1)"

CVE_2019_17133_SUMMARY_en="In the Linux kernel through 5.3.2, cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid in net/wireless/wext-sme.c does not reject a long SSID IE, leading to a Buffer Overflow."
